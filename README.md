# decode-test-suite

Test Suite configuration for the DECODE project as created by the Arduino Development 

Once the test suite has been installed, you can run the test suite as root by issuing the command:

phoronix-test-suite run local/decode-suite

This installation will take several hours on an embedded board. Leave it working and go out for dinner with friends or something.
